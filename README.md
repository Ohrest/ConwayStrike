A simple multi-user implementation of John Conway's game of life based on ReactJS for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end and Socket.IO for the real-time integration.
A new epoch is computed every 0.5 seconds, all users see and interact with the same board and the Chatbox updates in real-time.

The project is running at the address: http://gameoflife.live
